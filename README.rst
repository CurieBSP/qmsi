Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller Software Interface
################################################

Overview
********

Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller Software Interface (QMSI) is a Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) for Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller products.
It currently support the following SoCs:

* Intel® Quark™ D2000 Microcontroller
* Intel® Quark™ SE Microcontroller

Support
*******

Information and support regarding Intel® Quark™ MCUs can be found in the
following website:

Hardware Compatibility
**********************

This release has been validated with the following hardware:

* Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller D2000 Series.
* Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller D2000 Development Platform.

External Dependencies
*********************

* The i586-intel-elfiamcu toolchain is required to build the source code.
* OpenOCD is required to flash applications and ROM files onto the SoC.
* GDB is optional, it is used as a supplement to OpenOCD for debugging.
* Intel® System Studio for Microcontrollers is optional.

Building
********

The build system is based on the make tool.

Targets
========

Debug and release builds are supported setting the ``BUILD`` variable.

To build in debug mode:

``make BUILD=debug``

To build in release mode:

``make BUILD=release``

Build modes
===========

The top level Makefile contains two targets: ``rom`` and ``libqmsi``. The output
directory is ``build``.

The ROM must be flashed on the OTP ROM flash region. To build the ``rom``
target, run:

``make rom``

Libqmsi is a library archive of all the QMSI drivers for the SoC.

To build the ``libqmsi`` target, run the following command from the top level
directory:

``make libqmsi``

To build any of the provided example apps run make inside the corresponding
directory or use the –C make option from the top level directory.

E.g. to build the ``hello_world`` example app (by default it will be built in
debug mode):

``make –C examples/hello_world``

Known Issues and Workarounds
****************************

=========== ====================================================================
Issue       MPR example app in release mode has spurious interrupt in
            Quark™ D2000
----------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Implication D2000 board generates an extra interrupt when running the MPR example
            app in release mode.
----------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Workaround  Run MPR example app in debug mode.
